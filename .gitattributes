# Let Git decide what to do, for every file. More on that later.
* text=auto
# Overwrite the above and declare files that will always have
# LF line endings on checkin and checkout. No ESLint/Prettier
# issues for those files.
*.js text eol=lf
*.jsx text eol=lf
# If you're using TypeScript, also add .ts, .tsx files
*.ts text eol=lf
*.tsx text eol=lf
# If you're using Prettier, you probably want LF in .json, .md, .css,
# and all the other files you're formatting with Prettier.
*.json text eol=lf
# An alternative is to ditch the above and make everything have LF on
# checkin/checkout, but I'm not sure what will happen with binary files.
